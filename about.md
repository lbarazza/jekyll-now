I'm just a normal guy passionate about AI and physics. In this website I'll share some of the things I learn about these topics, and possibly something else too if I feel like it. :)

### More Information

I'm 17 and I live in a little town in northern Italy. I've always been very passionate about Artificial Intelligence and physics. My favorite musical genres are indie rock and alternative rock (in particular, I love R.E.M.). I also suck at cooking.
